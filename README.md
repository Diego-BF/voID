## Compiling
### Ubuntu

For compiling you must have installed all SDL2 libs. For installing run:
    
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

After installing go to the project folder and run:

    make clean
    make
    make run
</p>

### Windows
